    product: "sunscreen",
    text: "Sunscreen, also known as sunblock or sun cream, is a photoprotective topical product for the skin that mainly absorbs, or to a much lesser extent reflects, some of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation and thus helps protect against sunburn and most importantly prevent skin cancer. Sunscreens come as lotions, sprays, gels, foams (such as an expanded foam lotion or whipped lotion[2]), sticks, powders and other topical products. SPF is a measure of how much UVB light a sunscreen can filter out. Dermatologists recommend using an SPF of at least 30, which Adarsh Vijay Mudgil, MD, a dermatologist practicing in New York, calls the magic number. SPF 15 blocks about 93 percent of UVB rays, while SPF 30 blocks about 97 percent of UVB rays. The ADA recommends an SPF of 30 or higher.",

    product: "moisturiser",
    text: "A moisturizer, or emollient, is a cosmetic preparation used for protecting, moisturizing, and lubricating the skin. These functions are normally performed by sebum produced by healthy skin. The most important times to use moisturizer are after a bath, shave or exfoliation. For some, this might be twice a day. Moisturizing after a shower is very important because hot water strips all the moisture and oils out of your skin, leaving it parched and dry. While hot water may be relaxing, it also wreaks havoc on your skin. Never skip the moisturizer. Moisturizing Reduces Skin Problems – Moisturizing everyday can reduce the chance of developing extreme dryness or oiliness. Both extremes are harmful for skin and cause common skin conditions like acne. Conceals Other Skin Blemishes – Using a daily moisturizer ensures that the skin’s blemishes are camouflaged.",

    product: "retinoids",
    text: "Retinoids are a class of chemicals that derive from vitamin A. Weaker forms are available over the counter (OTC), and a doctor may prescribe stronger formulations of retinoids to help treat skin conditions. Retinoids can be natural or synthetic and include many types and forms, such as retinol, retinal, and retinyl esters. Retinoids have wide use in cosmetics and dermatology treatments. The most common use is to treat mild to moderate acne. By unclogging pores, retinoids allow topical antibiotics to get inside the pores. These two actions can help eliminate acne-causing bacteria. They also help prevent skin aging, psoriasis, pigment conditions and certain types of cancer. While retinoids can help treat some conditions, people should still take care when using them, as they can irritate the skin, particularly in people with skin allergies, dry skin, or sensitive skin.",

    product: "cleanser",
    text: "A facial cleanser is a skincare product used to remove make-up, dead skin cells, oil, dirt, and other types of pollutants from the skin, helping to keep pores clear and prevent skin conditions such as acne. Finding the best cleanser can be tough given there are so many options. Knowing the differences between them will help you choose the best products for your skin. The normal pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.5. When you cleanse your skin, there is an Poppingsaction that occurs between the cleanser, the skin’s moisture barrier and the skin’s pH. Soaps contain harsh surfactants that can alter the skin barrier and increase skin pH—increasing the potential for dryness and irritation. Soap-free gel, cream and foam cleansers are formulated to be as effective, but gentler, causing less disruption to the skin barrier and minimal change to skin pH.",

    product: "AHA/BHA",
    text: "AHA stands for alpha-hydoxy acid. AHAs are derived from sugar cane or other plant sources, which is why they are often referred to as fruit acids, says Howe. Among AHAs is glycolic acid, which, according to Howe, is the smallest of the AHAs, is derived from sugar cane, and is the most widely used type in skincare products. Markowitz notes that AHAs are generally recommended for normal to dry, sun-damaged skin, thanks to their ability to enhance natural moisturizing factors within the skin. AHAs have a number of benefits. For one, they target all areas of the skin. AHAs exert benefits both to the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) and the deep layer (the dermis), says Howe. In the epidermis, AHAs have an exfoliative effect, increasing the shedding of dead skin cells retained at the surface. They do this by gently cleaving the retained bonds between dead skin cells. Once cut loose, those cells can then fall off, or exfoliate.",

      "BHA stands for beta-hydroxy acid. That ever-popular acne-busting ingredient, salicylic acid? Yep, that's a BHA. BHAs are organic carboxylic acids that work on skin’s surface and deep inside the pore, explains Markowitz. They are oil-soluble, so it’s most often preferred for normal to oily skin that's prone to bumps, clogs, blemishes, and enlarged pores. Howe notes that while BHAs are structurally similar to AHAs, they differ in their position of the one hydroxyl group. Users of BHAs will reap the skin-calming properties of the acid (it gets bonus points for being gentle enough for sensitive skin types, including those prone to redness or rosacea). This rings true with the most familiar type of BHA, salicylic acid, too. Salicylic acid (SA) is fat-soluble, so it’s good on oily skin and gives it an enhanced ability to penetrate pores, says Howe.",

    product: "azelaic acid",
    text: "Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid found in grains such as barley, wheat, and rye. It has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which make it effective in the treatment of skin conditions like acne and rosacea. The acid can prevent future outbreaks and clean bacteria from your pores that causes acne. Azelaic acid is applied to your skin and is available in gel, foam, and cream form. Azelex and Finacea are two brand names for prescription topical preparations. They contain 15 percent or more of azelaic acid. Some over-the-counter products contain smaller amounts. Because it takes some time to take effect, azelaic acid by itself isn’t typically a dermatologist’s first choice for treating acne. The acid also has some side effects, such as skin burning, dryness, and peeling. Azelaic acid works by: clearing your pores of bacteria that may be causing irritation or breakouts reducing inflammation so acne becomes less visible, less red, and less irritated gently encouraging cell turnover so your skin heals more quickly and scarring is minimized",

    product: "niacinamide",
    text: "Niacinamide or Nicotinamide is a form of vitamin B₃ found in food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. As a supplement, it is used by mouth to prevent and treat pellagra. While nicotinic acid may be used for this purpose, niacinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing. Many topical niacinamide products come in the form of serums. Think of serums as extra treatments that address individual skin concerns outside of regular cleansing, toning, and moisturizing. Your niacinamide serum should be applied after toning but before moisturizing. Some cleansers and creams also contain niacinamide. This ingredient is also found in some face masks, which are rinsed off after each use. Read each product label carefully and follow all instructions for use. When used topically every day, niacinamide may have a positive impact on your overall skin health. The ingredient can help reduce inflammation and hyperpigmentation, smooth your overall skin texture, and brighten your skin.",

    product: "vitamin c",
    text: "Vitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning it halts or holds off environmental and sun damage to cells. And while you can count your morning OJ as a good defense for your bod, the best way to achieve vitamin C’s protection and benefits is to apply it directly onto your skin. But there’s also a reason why you don’t want to just be placing citrus slices on your cheeks. When you DIY, there’s no control over the quality — and sometimes it’s not even safe. It’s also just not efficient. That’s because when we eat, drink, or supplement vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, our skin only gets a small fractionTrusted Source of the benefits. However, pressing vitamin C in serum form, after it’s been chemically altered, actually lets our skin absorb more of it in an efficient way. If you’re wondering when to apply a vitamin C serum, the answer is both morning and night, after cleansing and toning. One study even recommends applying a vitamin C serum every eight hours, or twice daily for the pinnacle of protection.",

    text: "Peptides are short chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Long chains of amino acids are called proteins. Chains of fewer than twenty amino acids are called oligopeptides, and include dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides. A polypeptide is a longer, continuous, unbranched peptide chain. Every day, it feels like there’s a trendy new skin care ingredient that’s said to change your skin for the better. Some ingredients are more hype than action, but others are really worth it — and peptides are an ingredient you won’t want to miss. Peptides, also called polypeptides, naturally occur in the skin, but they’re also included in many skin care products — and for good reason. Peptides are amino acids that make up certain proteins needed by the skin. More specifically, collagen is made of three polypeptide chains, so adding peptides can stimulate your skin to make collagen. More collagen can lead to firmer, younger-looking skin.",

Hyaluronic acid is often produced by fermenting certain types of bacteria. Rooster combs (the red, Mohawk-like growth on top of a rooster’s head and face) are also a common source. Hyaluronic acid products come in various forms that you put on your skin. These include shampoos, lotions, creams, gels, ointments, patches and serums. You can also buy hyaluronic acid powder and mix it with water to create a hyaluronic acid serum you can apply to your skin. Long-term use of hyaluronic acid serum on your skin or in a supplement taken by mouth can improve overall skin health. It’s also great for helping improve overall skin flexibility and elasticity (meaning it makes your skin more stretchy and soft). Hyaluronic acid is widely used as an ingredient in fillers that repair or conceal scars left behind by acne.",
